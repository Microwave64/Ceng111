This is my first homework that I have struggle to do in my Department.
In this homework, I am expected to write a code which calculates the area between a rectangle and the x axis by using conditional statements. 
Also, there is lots of restrictions there, such as no function, library, or iteration statements etc.
I solved tihs problem by generalizing the problem by separate it three different subconditions which are based on the locations of two points are middle in terms of x values.
Then I find methods to calculate each different subconditions.
Via application of methods, I have completed this code.
You can find more detailed information on THE2(1).pdf file.
