#First Internship in Computer Science.
I have worked in IT team of Meteksan Matbaa as an intern in July - August 2023.
I have took part in a project of this department 
Our responsiblity in this project is, creating a program which can estimate future values of wanted datas and write them into a excel table.
Firstly, as a team we get the wanted data related with publishing in Turkey by Web-Scraping in python with BeautifulSoup library.
Then, we create a mathematical model of estimations, such as linear regression so on.
After that, via application of Machine Learning based library sklearn, data processing libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn; we create the estimator program derived from the mathematical models.
Finally, we respresented our program to the manager, and director of department.
